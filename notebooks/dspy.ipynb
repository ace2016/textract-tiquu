       " Example({'text_block': 'The Brundtland report speaks of two concerns that should be reconciled: development and the environment. They can also be interpreted as needs versus resources, or as the short versus the long term. Today, however, sustainability is almost always seen in terms of three dimensions: social, economic and environmental [8-11]. This is embodied in the definition of sustainability adopted by the United Nations in its Agenda for Development: Development is a multidimensional undertaking to achieve a higher quality of life for all people. Economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development [12]. But what are economic and social development and how are they different? Robert Gibson, a political scientist, says that the distinction is needed because “material gains are not sufficient measures or preservers of human well-being” [13]. The same author also suggests that the three dimensions or ‘pillars’ reflect the disciplines of those who study sustainability, adding for good measure that a cultural and a political pillar could also be included [13]. Gibson himself, by the way, rejects the idea of pillars altogether and instead formulates seven principles on which sustainability could be based. The idea of sustainability having three dimensions stems from the Triple Bottom Line concept, coined by Elkington [14]. As the term bottom line suggests, it originates from the world of management science, and Elkington intended it as a way to operationalize corporate social responsibility. To the conventional bottom line (profit) should be added care for the environment (the planet) as well as being good to people, for instance by providing facilities for the handicapped and hiring minorities (the social dimension). The goals of business, however, are very different from those of public policy. Although, as in business, revenue is needed to cover government expenditure, maximizing the excess of revenue over expenditure is not normally considered an appropriate goal for government policy. Government is not supposed to be a profit-making venture. The ‘profit’ pillar is therefore translated as the money made by the entire country, expressed as gross domestic product (GDP). This then is the economic dimension, and the social dimension (‘people’) is everything else connected with human aspirations: equity (translated as income distribution), inclusion (commonly operationalized as employment) and health (expressed by an indicator such as life expectancy or access to medical services). However, the equation of ‘economic’ with money is a very limited view of economics. Moreover, the view is further restricted if we confine ourselves to the aggregate amount, and not with its distribution or with what the money can buy. GDP is intended as a measure of welfare, and as such it is a very useful but also a very incomplete and biased one. It is useful for measuring the amount of economic activity and because there are relatively good data for it; but it needs to complemented by other indices, such as the Human Development Index. These are subjects of study for both economics and sociology, and there is no good reason to call one aspect economic and the others social. The sociologist would ask what welfare is and how it can be measured (an issue discussed in the next section), whereas the economist’s task would be to assess, given human aspirations and the scarcity of resources, what course of action is likely to produce the highest degree of satisfaction of those aspirations. If there is good reason from a conceptual point of view to prefer a single socio-economic dimension, what of its usefulness to policy analysts? Let us consider a hypothetical project which scores very well on the environmental dimension but rather poorly on both the social and the economic one. This might easily lead a policy-maker to conclude that the project is, on the whole, not a good idea. A two-dimensional approach might bring about the opposite judgment: its environmental benefits come at a cost in terms of welfare. The environmental dimension may thus receive less weight in a three-dimensional approach. Indeed, some authors explicitly state that the three dimensions should receive equal weight [15]. Since socio-economic aspects are mostly about the well-being of the present generation and environmental ones are about caring for the future, this means the former become twice as important as the latter—which violates the Brundtland requirement that development should not take place at the expense of future generations. Worse, perhaps, is that the contradiction between our desire for a better life and our concern for what this may do to the environment is obscured by conceptualizing these two concerns into three dimensions, and then suggesting that a solution is possible where all three are in harmony. Sustainability then becomes a concept that is equivalent to ‘good’ and thus devoid of any specific meaning—a blanket concept to assure stakeholders of the policy’s good intentions. The strength and relevance of the original Brundtland concept was precisely that it posed the question of how to reconcile one goal ‘development’ with another ‘sustainability’. The two goals are often in tension. Therefore, we propose to use the word sustainability in the sense as it was intended by the Brundtland Commission, and not as it has been coined later by corporate types and policy-makers. In the words of Robert Solow [16]: If ‘sustainability’ is anything more than a slogan or expression of emotion, it must amount to an injunction to preserve productive capacity for the indefinite future. Such a concept must be confronted with the socio-economic dimension of human aspirations for a better life: welfare, well-being, development or some similar concept. Which of these concepts it should be is the topic of the following section, before returning to our exploration of sustainability.', 'splits': ['The Brundtland report speaks of two concerns that should be reconciled: development and the environment.

       "'The concept of sustainability was originally coined in forestry, where it means never harvesting more than what the forest yields in new growth [2]. The word Nachhaltigkeit (the German term for sustainability) was first used with this meaning in 1713 [3]. The concern with preserving natural resources for the future is perennial, of course: undoubtedly our Palaeolithic ancestors worried about their prey becoming extinct, and early farmers must have been apprehensive about maintaining soil fertility. Traditional beliefs enjoined thinking in terms of stewardship and concern for future generations, as expressed in the oft-quoted words of a Nigerian tribal chief who saw the community as consisting of “many dead, few living and countless others unborn” [4,5]. Perhaps there have always been two opposing views of the relation between humankind and nature: one which stresses adaptation and harmony, and another which sees nature as something to be conquered. While this latter view may have been rather dominant in Western civilization at least in recent centuries, its counterpoint has never been absent. Sustainability (without necessarily using the word) is a natural topic of study for economists: after all, the scarcity of resources is of central concern to the dismal science. A famous example is the work of Thomas Malthus, who published his theory about looming mass starvation (due to the inability of available agricultural land to feed an expanding population) in 1798. A theory on the optimal rate of exploitation of non-renewable resource which is still relevant today was formulated by Harold Hotelling, an American economist, in 1931 [6]. We shall have more to say about his views later. A milestone in capturing the attention of global public policy was the report of the Club of Rome [7], which predicted that many natural resources crucial to our survival would be exhausted within one or two generations. Such pessimism is unbecoming in public policy which is, after all, supposed to be about improving things. Therefore, the report of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, better known as the Brundtland Report after its chairperson, was welcomed for showing a way out of impending doom. It was this report which adopted the concept of sustainability and gave it the widespread recognition it enjoys today. The question which Brundtland and her colleagues posed themselves was: how can the aspirations of the world’s nations for a better life be reconciled with limited natural resources and the dangers of environmental degradation? Their answer is sustainable development, in the Commission’s words: development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [1]. Thus, environmental concerns are important, but the basic argument is one of welfare, seen in a context of inter-generational equity. We should care for the environment not because of its intrinsic value, but in order to preserve resources for our children. Since that time, there have been two major developments in the concept of sustainability: one, its interpretation in terms of three dimensions, which must be in harmony: social, economic and environmental. Two, the distinction between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ sustainability. These two developments are discussed critically in the Sections 3–4 and 5–6, respectively.'"

       "['The Brundtland report speaks of two concerns that should be reconciled: development and the environment. They can also be interpreted as needs versus resources, or as the short versus the long term. Today, however, sustainability is almost always seen in terms of three dimensions: social, economic and environmental [8-11].',\n",
       " 'This is embodied in the definition of sustainability adopted by the United Nations in its Agenda for Development: Development is a multidimensional undertaking to achieve a higher quality of life for all people. Economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development [12]. But what are economic and social development and how are they different?',\n",
       " 'Robert Gibson, a political scientist, says that the distinction is needed because “material gains are not sufficient measures or preservers of human well-being” [13].',\n",
       " 'The same author also suggests that the three dimensions or ‘pillars’ reflect the disciplines of those who study sustainability, adding for good measure that a cultural and a political pillar could also be included [13].',\n",
       " 'Gibson himself, by the way, rejects the idea of pillars altogether and instead formulates seven principles on which sustainability could be based.',\n",
       " 'The idea of sustainability having three dimensions stems from the Triple Bottom Line concept, coined by Elkington [14].',\n",
       " 'As the term bottom line suggests, it originates from the world of management science, and Elkington intended it as a way to operationalize corporate social responsibility.',\n",
       " 'To the conventional bottom line (profit) should be added care for the environment (the planet) as well as being good to people, for instance by providing facilities for the handicapped and hiring minorities (the social dimension).',\n",
       " 'The goals of business, however, are very different from those of public policy.',\n",
       " 'Although, as in business, revenue is needed to cover government expenditure, maximizing the excess of revenue over expenditure is not normally considered an appropriate goal for government policy. Government is not supposed to be a profit-making venture.',\n",
       " 'The ‘profit’ pillar is therefore translated as the money made by the entire country, expressed as gross domestic product (GDP).',\n",
       " 'This then is the economic dimension, and the social dimension (‘people’) is everything else connected with human aspirations: equity (translated as income distribution), inclusion (commonly operationalized as employment) and health (expressed by an indicator such as life expectancy or access to medical services).',\n",
       " 'However, the equation of ‘economic’ with money is a very limited view of economics.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, the view is further restricted if we confine ourselves to the aggregate amount, and not with its distribution or with what the money can buy.',\n",
       " 'GDP is intended as a measure of welfare, and as such it is a very useful but also a very incomplete and biased one.',\n",
       " 'It is useful for measuring the amount of economic activity and because there are relatively good data for it; but it needs to complemented by other indices, such as the Human Development Index.',\n",
       " 'These are subjects of study for both economics and sociology, and there is no good reason to call one aspect economic and the others social.',\n",
       " 'The sociologist would ask what welfare is and how it can be measured (an issue discussed in the next section), whereas the economist’s task would be to assess, given human aspirations and the scarcity of resources, what course of action is likely to produce the highest degree of satisfaction of those aspirations.',\n",
       " 'If there is good reason from a conceptual point of view to prefer a single socio-economic dimension, what of its usefulness to policy analysts?',\n",
       " 'Let us consider a hypothetical project which scores very well on the environmental dimension but rather poorly on both the social and the economic one.',\n",
       " 'This might easily lead a policy-maker to conclude that the project is, on the whole, not a good idea.',\n",
       " 'A two-dimensional approach might bring about the opposite judgment: its environmental benefits come at a cost in terms of welfare. The environmental dimension may thus receive less weight in a three-dimensional approach.',\n",
       " 'Indeed, some authors explicitly state that the three dimensions should receive equal weight [15].',\n",
       " 'Since socio-economic aspects are mostly about the well-being of the present generation and environmental ones are about caring for the future, this means the former become twice as important as the latter—which violates the Brundtland requirement that development should not take place at the expense of future generations.',\n",
       " 'Worse, perhaps, is that the contradiction between our desire for a better life and our concern for what this may do to the environment is obscured by conceptualizing these two concerns into three dimensions, and then suggesting that a solution is possible where all three are in harmony.',\n",
       " 'Sustainability then becomes a concept that is equivalent to ‘good’ and thus devoid of any specific meaning—a blanket concept to assure stakeholders of the policy’s good intentions.',\n",
       " 'The strength and relevance of the original Brundtland concept was precisely that it posed the question of how to reconcile one goal ‘development’ with another ‘sustainability’.',\n",
       " 'The two goals are often in tension.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, we propose to use the word sustainability in the sense as it was intended by the Brundtland Commission, and not as it has been coined later by corporate types and policy-makers.',\n",
       " 'In the words of Robert Solow [16]: If ‘sustainability’ is anything more than a slogan or expression of emotion, it must amount to an injunction to preserve productive capacity for the indefinite future.',\n",
       " 'Such a concept must be confronted with the socio-economic dimension of human aspirations for a better life: welfare, well-being, development or some similar concept.']"

This evolution reflects a growing awareness of the interconnectedness of ecological health, economic stability, and social equity.\", \n",

Theories such as circular economy and sustainable development advocate for systems that minimize waste and promote resource efficiency. These economic frameworks encourage businesses and governments to rethink their strategies in favor of practices that support both the planet and people.\", \n",

Different philosophical viewpoints, from utilitarianism to deep ecology, offer diverse perspectives on how we should value nature and make decisions that affect the environment. This ethical dimension is crucial for fostering a culture of sustainability that prioritizes long-term well-being over immediate gains.\", \n",

This recognition is essential for creating frameworks that support sustainable development at local, national, and global levels.\", \n",
